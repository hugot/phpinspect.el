PATTERN is a plist with the allowed keys being :m and :f. Each
key-value pair in the plist defines a match operation that is
applied to the corresponding index of SEQUENCE (so for ex.: key 0
is applied to pos. 0 of SEQUENCE, key 1 to pos. 1, and so on).

Possible match operations:

:m - This key can be used to match a list element to the literal
value supplied for it, using the `equal' comparison function. For
example, providing `(\"foobar\") as value will result in the
comparison (equal (elt SEQUENCE pos) `(\"foobar\")). There is one
exception to this rule: using the symbol * as value for the :m
key will match anything, essentially skipping comparison for the
element at this position in SEQUENCE.

:f - This key can be used to match a list element by executing
the function provided as value. The function is executed with the
list element as argument, and will be considered as matching if
it evaluates to a non-nil value."
